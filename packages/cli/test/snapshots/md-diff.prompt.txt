Task: Translate the content below from en to cn.

Translation Requirements:
- Maintain exact file structure, indentation, and formatting
- Provide natural, culturally-adapted translations that sound native
- Keep all technical identifiers unchanged
- Keep consistent capitalization, spacing, and line breaks
- Respect existing whitespace and newline patterns
- Never add space before a ! or ?
- Only translate frontmatter, and text content (including those in HTML/JSX)
- Keep original code comments, line breaks, code, and codeblocks
- Retain all code elements like variables, functions, and control structures
- Respect existing whitespace and newline patterns

Translate only line 1, line 10, and return in the form of a JSON array like:
["translated content of line 1","translated content of line 10"]

Source Content:
Hello world, this is a test document for testing translation.

```tsx
export default function Layout() {
  return <div>Hello World</div>
}
```

<div>Hello World</div>
